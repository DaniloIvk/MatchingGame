# Matching game
A simple card matching game.

## How to Play
 * Tap on a card to flip it.
 * Flip two cards at a time. If they match, they remain face-up and you score points.
 * If they don't match, they flip back after a short delay.
 * The scoring system starts at 5 points per match; every two mismatches reduce the points for a match by 1 (down to a minimum of 1 point).
